<!-- $title Mobile First by Maximilian Hoffmann -->
<!-- $description I have been familiar with mobile first and its advantages for a long time, but my blog’s latest iteration is the first site which actually uses this approach. First I had started implementing the new design desktop first and added mobile styles later via media queries, but after having seen Brad Frost’s inspiring talk “Beyond Media Queries” I have finally changed my mind and wrote the CSS from scratch, which was the best decision I could make. My styles are smaller in file size, easier to maintain and flexible like never before. -->
