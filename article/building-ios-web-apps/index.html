<!-- $title Building iOS Web Apps by Maximilian Hoffmann -->
<!-- $description Remote debugging web applications is available since iOS6. With remote debugging it is easy to check and alter the rendered CSS and test the functionality of your app on the device itself. Instead of Safari I recommend you to use the latest Nightly WebKit, which has more features and a better interface. Changes to WebKitâ€™s developer tools since Safari 6 can be found on https://gist.github.com/paulmillr/4056234. -->
