# Effective Web Development Teams

## 24th of August, 2013

Some days ago I stumbled across the ["Joel Test"](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html) for software teams by Joel Stolsky, which includes 12 steps to better code. His post inspired me to write my own test especially for web development teams as I think it differs in some points. This may also be handy during interviews when itâ€™s your turn to ask questions.

### Answer these questions with "yes" or "no":

1. Do you use version control?
2. Do you start projects with prototypes?
3. Do you have daily meetings?
4. Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
5. Do you have a database for bugs and issues?
6. Do you write automated tests?
7. Do you use a build process for front-end and back-end?
8. Do you write open source software?
9. Do you support side projects?
10. Do you have a budget for training or conferences?

Give your team 1 point for each "yes" answer. 10 points are perfect and 9 tolerable. If you have 8 points and below ask yourself why you had to answer questions with "no" and how you could change that.

_PS: If you have a perfect score and a free front-end position in Berlin I would love to get in contact._
