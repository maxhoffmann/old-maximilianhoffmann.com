I started with Addy Osmani’s free “Learning JavaScript Design Patterns”, read “JavaScript: The Good Parts” by Douglas Crockford, then went on with “Effective JavaScript” by David Herman, learned about “Maintainable JavaScript” from Nicolas Zarkasas and am currently half through “Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja” by John Resig and Bear Bibeault. -->
